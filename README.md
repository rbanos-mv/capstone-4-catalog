# Catalog of my things

> This is the Ruby capstone group project.
> In this project, we create a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but we have also prepared a database with tables structure analogical to our program's class structure.
